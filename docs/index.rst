django-calaccess-campaign-browser
=================================

A Django app to refine and investigate campaign finance data drawn from the
California Secretary of State's CAL-ACCESS database.

Intended as a second layer atop `django-calaccess-raw-data <https://github.com/california-civic-data-coalition/django-calaccess-raw-data>`_
that transforms the source data, loads it into simplified models to serve as a platform
for investigative analysis.
